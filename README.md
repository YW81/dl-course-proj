# Deep Learning and Stacked AutoEncoders

This project is a revised version of [DeepLearnToolbox](https://github.com/rasmusbergpalm/DeepLearnToolbox), serving as a course project for `Brain Cognition and Deep Learning`.

The key work of this project is to have **an empirical study** of Deep Learning and Stacked AutoEncoders. To have a deeper insight, I revised some of the codes to monitor more information about the networks.

The main file of this project is `test_NN_SAE.m`. Since this study focuses on **Deep Learning and Stacked AutoEncoders**, related directories are


- `NN/` - A library for Feedforward Backpropagation Neural Networks
- `SAE/` - A library for Stacked (Denoising) Auto-Encoders
- `util/` - Utility functions used by the libraries
- `data/` - Data used by the examples

*Please note that files within above directories may be revised for my study needs. Always, you can check the source code for more information.*

If any suggestions or questions, feel free to push a request or email me through yuanzhigang10@163.com.

*If you are looking for my report of this course project, you can email me to get it. Since it's for a course project, I will not make it public.*
